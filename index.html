            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

              <h2>Hello World</h2>
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello   world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
              function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

              <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p class="dec-var">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p class="dec-var">With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>
              var x = 42.
            </code>
            <p class="dec-var">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p class="dec-var">By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>
              x = 42.
            </code>
            <p class="dec-var">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p class="dec-var">With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>
              let y = 13.
            </code>
            <p class="dec-var">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
          <header id="heder-section">
            <h2>Variable scope</h2>
          </header>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
          <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
          <code>
            if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
          </code>
          <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
          <code class="last-li">
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined
          </code>

          <section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
            <header id="header-section">
              <h2>Global variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
